**_Using flutter_**

     Important package is tflite (to run tensorflow model) and all packages with versions compatability is in pubspec.yml

     To run app connect your phone with pc then just when open this project on your editor, run in terminal (flutter pub get) then run "main.dart"

We made the model recognize 7 emotions in desktop, but in mobile app for simplicity we just use 3 emotions (happy, sad, surprise)

**_The app consists of_** 

    -homePage.dart to take children name to be welcomed by name in other pages 
    
    -emotions page 
    
    -history to show the daily report with scores of copying the emotions and share it with therapist
     
     via email or whatsapp (this page did not finish yet)
